Amazon Sagemaker deployment - Udacity Nanodegree Project
Deploying a Pytorch model in Amazon Sagemaker and access it through open endpoint Amazon Lambda function

Creating a Sentiment Analysis Web App
Using PyTorch and SageMaker
Deep Learning Nanodegree Program | Deployment

Now that we have a basic understanding of how SageMaker works we will try to use it to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.
